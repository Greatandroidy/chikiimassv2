The Rich Text Field is a powerful way to allow editors to write dynamic content. The content is saved as JSON in the database and can be converted into any format, including HTML, that you need.

Payload's rich text field is built on an "adapter pattern" which lets you specify which rich text editor you'd like to use.

Right now, Payload is officially supporting two rich text editors:

1. [SlateJS](/docs/rich-text/slate) - stable, backwards-compatible with 1.0
2. [Lexical](/docs/lexical/overview) - beta, where things will be moving

  <strong>
    Consistent with Payload's goal of making you learn as little of Payload as possible, customizing
    and using the Rich Text Editor does not involve learning how to develop for a
    {' '}
    <em>Payload</em>
    {' '}
    rich text editor.
  </strong>

  Instead, you can invest your time and effort into learning the underlying open-source tools that
  will allow you to apply your learnings elsewhere as well.

## Admin Options

The customize the appearance and behavior of the Rich Text Field in the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), you can use the `admin` option:

```ts
import type { Field } from 'payload/types'

export const MyRichTextField: Field = {
  // ...
  admin: { // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The Rich Text Field inherits all of the default options from the base [Field Admin Config](../admin/fields#admin-options), plus the following additional options:

| Property                       | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`placeholder`**              | Set this property to define a placeholder string for the field.                                                                         |
| **`hideGutter`**               | Set this property to `true` to hide this field's gutter within the Admin Panel.                                                         |
| **`rtl`**                      | Override the default text direction of the Admin Panel for this field. Set to `true` to force right-to-left text direction.            |
